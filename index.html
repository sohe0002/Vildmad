        <h2>Mushrooms</h2>
        <p>There are many different types of mushrooms that can look in mysterious ways. Most mushrooms are
          characterized by having a stem and a cap, and under the cap, there are either gills or tubes. Gills look like
          strings that run from the outer edge of the cap to the stem. Generally, mushrooms with tubes (those with tubes
          under the cap) are edible and tasty, with little risk in picking and eating them. Mushrooms with gills under
          the cap require more caution. While they can be delicious and safe to eat, many taste bad (without being
          harmful), and some are outright poisonous. Additionally, there are other mushrooms that don't look like
          typical mushrooms but can still be edible if you know how to handle them.</p>

        <h2>Fouragering</h2>
        <p>At forage and cook wild food isn't hard. You don't need to be a nature guide, biologist, or chef. It just
          requires using your common sense and senses - and a bit of planning before heading into nature. Whether you
          know exactly what ingredients you're looking for or approach it more openly and curiously, it's a good idea to
          consider these questions before stepping out the door.
        </p>
        <p>When foraging, it's important to always show respect for nature. Harvest with consideration for nature's
          cycles and the next forager. Always leave something for the next harvester and never pick the last one. Pick a
          lot of what is abundant and less of the others. Exercise more restraint with plants that grow more sparsely.
